I want to notify about updates from my pwa
- periodic background sync is seriously nerfed (once every 12h for chrome)
- web push requires showing a notification in chrome
- web push requires a server
- safari doesn't support web notifications (thx apple)

luckily i have telegram and telegram caches messages to bots for 24h.
as my pwa is updated via github actions i can fetch telegram messages and send notifications in github actions as well

* notes
not even sure encryption is required. i guess telegram chat ids cannot be used by anyone but the participants and cannot be correlated to the user id
but hey, why not
